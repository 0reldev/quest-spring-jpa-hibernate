# Quest 

## Educational exercise from Wild Code School

This quest introduces Spring Data JPA and Hibernate. 

The purpose is to create and edit a simple database of characters and schools from the Harry Potter's universe.

The quest teaches how to create entities with Hibernate. An exemple is given for the <code>Wizard</code> (create, read, update and deletion actions) with HTML forms,
and the same was required for the <code>School</code> entity.
